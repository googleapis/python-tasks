        State of the queue.

        Attributes:
          STATE_UNSPECIFIED (int): Unspecified state.
          RUNNING (int): The queue is running. Tasks can be dispatched.

          If the queue was created using Cloud Tasks and the queue has had no
          activity (method calls or task dispatches) for 30 days, the queue may
          take a few minutes to re-activate. Some method calls may return
          ``NOT_FOUND`` and tasks may not be dispatched for a few minutes until
          the queue has been re-activated.
          PAUSED (int): Tasks are paused by the user. If the queue is paused then Cloud
          Tasks will stop delivering tasks from it, but more tasks can still be
          added to it by the user. When a pull queue is paused, all ``LeaseTasks``
          calls will return a ``FAILED_PRECONDITION``.
          DISABLED (int): The queue is disabled.

          A queue becomes ``DISABLED`` when
          `queue.yaml <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/queueref>`__
          or
          `queue.xml <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/config/queueref>`__
          is uploaded which does not contain the queue. You cannot directly
          disable a queue.

          When a queue is disabled, tasks can still be added to a queue but the
          tasks are not dispatched and ``LeaseTasks`` calls return a
          ``FAILED_PRECONDITION`` error.

          To permanently delete this queue and all of its tasks, call
          ``DeleteQueue``.

        When a task is returned in a response, not all information is retrieved
        by default because some data, such as payloads, might be desirable to
        return only when needed because of its large size or because of the
        sensitivity of data that it contains.

        Attributes:
          VIEW_UNSPECIFIED (int): Unspecified. Defaults to BASIC.
          BASIC (int): The basic view omits fields which can be large or can contain
          sensitive data.

          This view does not include the (``payload in AppEngineHttpRequest`` and
          ``payload in PullMessage``). These payloads are desirable to return only

          the data that you choose to store in it.
