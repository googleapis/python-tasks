                Required. The task to add.

                Task names have the following format:
                ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID``.
                The user can optionally specify a task
                [name][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.name]. If a name
                is not specified then the system will generate a random

                in the [response][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.name].

                If
                [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time]
                is not set or is in the past then Cloud Tasks will set
                it to the current time.

                Task De-duplication:

                Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task
                de-duplication. If a task's ID is identical to that of
                an existing task or a task that was deleted or completed
                recently then the call will fail with
                [ALREADY_EXISTS][google.rpc.Code.ALREADY_EXISTS]. If the
                task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another
                task with the same name can't be created for ~1hour
                after the original task was deleted or completed. If the
                task's queue was created using queue.yaml or queue.xml,
                then another task with the same name can't be created
                for ~9days after the original task was deleted or
                completed.

                Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify
                duplicate task names, these
                [CreateTask][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CreateTask]
                calls have significantly increased latency. Using hashed
                strings for the task id or for the prefix of the task id
                is recommended. Choosing task ids that are sequential or
                have sequential prefixes, for example using a timestamp,
                causes an increase in latency and error rates in all
                task commands. The infrastructure relies on an
                approximately uniform distribution of task ids to store
                and serve tasks efficiently.

                This corresponds to the ``task`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this

        The worker can use this method to cancel a task's lease by
        setting its
        [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time]
        to now. This will make the task available to be leased to the
        next caller of
        [LeaseTasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.LeaseTasks].

        Args:
            request (Union[google.cloud.tasks_v2beta2.types.CancelLeaseRequest, dict]):

                lease using
                [CancelLease][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.CancelLease].
            name (str):
                Required. The task name. For example:
                ``projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID``

                This corresponds to the ``name`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            schedule_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
                Required. The task's current schedule time, available in
                the
                [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time]
                returned by
                [LeaseTasks][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.LeaseTasks]
                response or
                [RenewLease][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.CloudTasks.RenewLease]
                response. This restriction is to ensure that your worker
                currently holds the lease.

                This corresponds to the ``schedule_time`` field
                on the ``request`` instance; if ``request`` is provided, this
                should not be set.
            retry (google.api_core.retry.Retry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                should be retried.
            timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
            metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]): Strings which should be
                sent along with the request as metadata.

        Returns:

                A unit of scheduled work.

        When this method is called, Cloud Tasks will dispatch the task,

        This command is meant to be used for manual debugging. For

        used to retry a failed task after a fix has been made or to
        manually force a task to be dispatched now.

        The dispatched task is returned. That is, the task that is
        returned contains the
        [status][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.status] after the task
        is dispatched but before the task is received by its target.

        If Cloud Tasks receives a successful response from the task's

        [schedule_time][google.cloud.tasks.v2beta2.Task.schedule_time]
